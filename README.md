## About Me

I'm a software developer with 21 years of skilled trades experience, now building commercial applications that solve real problems in industries I know firsthand.

I'm the founder of **Lajoie Analytics** and creator of **Coatbase** — a professional paint mixing and inventory management SaaS for sign shops and graphics companies. What started as a 400-line prototype has evolved into a 14,000+ line production application featuring real-time scale integration, PDF formula parsing, Stripe payment processing, and multi-tenant cloud sync.

My trades background (17 years as an automotive paint technician, 4 years in sign manufacturing) gives me a unique perspective — I build software for people who actually use their hands, not just their keyboards.

B.S. in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University, graduated with a 3.9 GPA.

- **Backend Systems**: Authentication (bcrypt), RSA-signed license validation, cloud sync services
