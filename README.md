### About Me:
I‚Äôm passionate about analyzing data, generating insights, and solving real-world problems through coding and software development. With a background in data analytics and a specialization in survey analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning, I thrive on transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive meaningful decisions.

Recently, I have been focusing on enhancing my coding skills by developing various applications and tools, including the **Paint Tracking Program** and **Funko Pop Collection Tracker**. These projects allowed me to apply my programming knowledge to create efficient, user-friendly applications while deepening my understanding of data management and analysis.

Over the years, I‚Äôve developed expertise in various tools and technologies, including Python, R, SQL, and data visualization platforms like Tableau and Power BI. As a software developer, I focus on creating efficient, scalable applications that enhance data manipulation and analysis. Whether it's building predictive models, developing software solutions, creating dashboards, or designing experiments, my goal is to leverage data and coding skills to uncover opportunities, streamline processes, and solve complex challenges.

As an independent data analyst and software developer, I have successfully delivered impactful solutions across multiple industries, including nonprofit organizations, finance, and emerging technologies like cryptocurrency. My experience includes working on projects like membership engagement analysis for nonprofits, predictive loan analysis, and clustering models for financial data.

I‚Äôm always eager to collaborate on projects that allow me to apply data science techniques and software development practices to real-world problems. My goal is to provide organizations with clear, actionable insights and robust applications that can help them make data-driven decisions with confidence.
